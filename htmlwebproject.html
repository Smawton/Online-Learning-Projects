			<h2 id="tribute-info"> The meeting of Diogenes and Alexander: </h2>
	<p class="blocktext"> If you were to think of a philosopher with integrity you'd need look no further than Diogenes of Synope. When approached by Alexander the Great (perhaps the most powerful man in the world at the time) and offered anything he wanted, he said: "Yes, stand a little out of my sun."
